# Doubles-Counter
The following is a C program that counts and sorts doubles from a file

This program demonstrates various skills such as memory allocation, file opening (reading, closing), array and pointer manipulation as well as basic i/o functions.  I have a basic header file with a list of numbers (doubles) in no particular order.  This program opens that file, scans throught the numbers, finds and counts the amount of doubles and sorts them using the quicksort command.
