# Doubles-Counter
The following is a C program that counts doubles from a file

This program demonstrates various skills such as memory allocation, file opening (reading and closing too).  I have a basic .txt file with a list of numbers in no particular order or format.  This program opens that file, scans throught the numbers, finds and counts the amount of doubles using the qsort command.
